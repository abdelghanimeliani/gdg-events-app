## Why Events app?
* _**Why** creating a GDG events application ?_ _**What** problems we can solve with it?_ You can ask this question, well the answer is as follows, we have worked to make event announcement easy for all types of users and publishers. And the amazing thing that we did is we added the gallery feature that the user can see past events, amazing moments and motivation to attend one of those events.
